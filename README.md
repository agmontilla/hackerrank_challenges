These are my personal solutions for [hackerrank challenges](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python).

## Continuos Integration workflow

I've added a GitHub action workflow to run unit tests automatically. My workflow is based on [Install Poetry Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-poetry-action)

## Coverage

**TODO**: It should be based on [this](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/install-poetry-action#codecov-upload) but I'm going to check it.

Other posibilities are:

- https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-python#testing-with-pytest-and-pytest-cov
- https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/202209/making_a_coverage_badge.html
